an open source golf tool by Ryan Mockabee

**This is a work in progress! I hope to have a functional demo completed by mid-November 2017. Please message me with any questions you have.**

*Executive Summary*
This is an open source tool designed as a way to practice my programming skills, as well as make an accessible free tool for fellow golfers to use on whatever device they want. This is a Python/Flask web application, with hosting to be determined at a later date. The initial build will have a tool to track distances based on clubs to help judge what clubs to use, and teaching tools will be added shortly after. Later features to be determined.

*Goals*
-10/15/2017: Get Travis-CI integration working for application testing.    
-10/30/2017: Program base application.  
-11/15/2017: Deploy demo to cloud for light testing.
